TURBONAME                                             
===================================================

Do you have a project that needs a short domain name, while maintaining some sense of redability?
This little tool will choose some random word in spanish or english, mix syllables, vocals until it finds a .com domain name available for that strange, made up-word.

While most of the results aren't that exiting you can find a gem watching the results of the script finding domain names.

Based on [Megoforce](https://github.com/megoforce/turboname)'s Turboname

## Requirements
- Ruby interpreter installed (1.9.2-p290 recommended). In most linux distributions and Mac OS X this comes right out of the box.
- Precious time
- Frustration tolerance.
- Water and Food
- Maybe a blanket.

## Instructions
Open a terminal window in the directory you extracted turboname and type: `ruby turboname.rb`
